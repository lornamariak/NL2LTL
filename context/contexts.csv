"finally ( and (  go to the yellow room , finally ( go to the green room )  )  )","The instruction generally prescribes that the robot should at some point go to a room colored yellow, and then subsequently move to a room colored green. Notably, the order of rooms visited makes a significant difference; the yellow room must be visited before the green room. While the journey may include transits through other rooms of different colors, the progression from the yellow room to the green room is mandatory. The language used to describe this action varied, using terms like 'move to', 'go through' or 'travel through'."
"finally ( and (  go to the red room , finally ( go to the blue room with chair )  )  )","The instruction in general terms is directing the robot to eventually transition to two actions: firstly going to the room designated as red, then after being in the red room, proceeding to move to the blue room, possibly with a chair. The robot might need to interact with some obstacles or objects such as retrieving or moving a chair, as indicated in some examples. It's also notable that the blue room might be interpreted as purple in some instances. Regardless of the small nuances in each example, the important factor is that the robot ends up in the red room, then the blue room."
"finally ( and (  go to the blue room , finally ( go to the red room )  )  )","The instruction in general terms requires the robot to pass through the blue room in order to reach the red room. The communication emphasizes the necessity of going through the blue room first, before eventually ending up in the red room. There's a specification about the order in which the rooms should be visited, indicating that the robot must not go directly to the red room but must instead make a stop or pass through the blue room. Thus, the path from any starting point would involve transitions involving the blue room and finally to the red room."
finally go to the blue room,"This instruction indicates that the robot should, at some point, move to the blue room. It does not necessarily specify when this needs to happen or from where the robot should start, only that the task of reaching the blue room must be completed. The navigation directions might include actions like exiting the current room or going right. The destination, the blue room in this case, is constant in all examples."
"and ( finally ( go to the blue room ) , globally ( not ( go to the yellow room ) ) )","The instruction generally tells the robot to navigate to the blue room, but with a crucial condition that it must avoid, at all costs, entering the yellow room. This stipulation is constant, indicating that no matter what path the robot takes, it should never find itself in the yellow room. All the different instructions discuss this travel situation differently, but they all uphold the rule of reaching the blue room without passing through the yellow room."
"finally ( and (  go to the yellow room , finally ( go to the blue room )  )  )","The instruction requires the robot to traverse two rooms: the yellow room and the blue room, in that specific order. The yellow room must be entered before the robot can proceed to the blue room, indicating a sequential action. It might involve the robot going directly from the yellow room to the blue room, or it could involve other actions between, but the main objective remains to eventually end up in the blue room after passing through the yellow room. This instruction commonly manifests in phrases such as 'go through the yellow room to the blue room' or 'enter the yellow room and then move to the blue room'."
"finally ( and (  go to the red room , finally ( go to the green room )  )  )","This instruction involves the robot moving towards two specified rooms in a sequential order. The robot is required, first, to go into the red room, and only after that, to proceed to the green room. The order in which the rooms are visited is essential, and the green room must be reached after the red room, never before. Synonyms could be used to indicate these rooms, such as 'area' instead of 'room', or the action might be phrased differently like 'move to', 'go through', or 'enter', however, the sequence remains unchanged. This means that before the second action - entering the green room - occurs, the first action - entering the red room - must be realized."
"and ( finally ( go to the green room ) , globally ( not ( go to the yellow room ) ) )","The instruction generally dictates that the robot must eventually reach the green room without at any point entering the yellow room. This implies that the robot must take a route that completely avoids the yellow room. The journey may be differentiated by the size or some other characteristic of the rooms, but the overarching principle remains consistent - get to the green room while avoiding the yellow room."
"finally ( and (  go to the red room , finally ( go to the green room with chair )  )  )","The given formula specifies an end goal where the robot must eventually locate and travel to the red room. Following this, it also needs to perform another action where it subsequently navigates to the green room, ideally with a chair. The sequence of these actions is significant; the movement to the green room must occur after the robot has been to the red room. This objective is realized through a variety of potential settings and circumstances, such as locating and moving objects that are colored yellow, or navigating from rooms of different colors. The directions also include manipulating objects in different ways, such as pushing them from the red room to the green room."
"and ( finally ( go to the blue room ) , globally ( not ( go to the red room ) ) )","This instruction indicates that the robot has to go to the blue room by avoiding the red room at all times. This means the robot should never enter the red room while making its way to the blue room. Synonyms of red and blue colors such as crimson, ruby, or scarlet for red, and azure, sapphire, or cobalt for blue could also be utilized in the instructions."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the red room , go to the yellow room ) , finally ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction describes a route that the robot must follow. It must, at some point, visit either the red or yellow rooms, and ultimately it must end up in the blue room. The order is crucial: the visit to the blue room must occur after the visit to the yellow or red room. The robot may perform other actions in between, but it's required that it visits the red or yellow room before finally moving to the blue room. Various phrases describe this, commonly involving terms like 'go', 'move', 'enter', 'reach', and 'get to' to denote motion, and 'through', 'to', 'into', 'toward', and 'by using' to specify direction and sequence. Alternatives for the rooms include 'passage', 'small room', and 'large room'."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the red room , go to the yellow room ) , finally ( go to the green room ) ) )","The instruction requires the robot to end up in the green room, but to do so it must first go through either the red room or the yellow room. This route could be direct or it may involve passing through both the red and yellow rooms, but the implication remains the same: the robot cannot reach the green room without first being in the red or yellow rooms. Note that the room colors are interchangeable in the instructions, meaning 'red' could be replaced with any color synonymous to red, 'yellow' could be replaced with any color synonymous to yellow, and so on."
"and ( finally ( go to the yellow room ) , globally ( not ( go to the red room ) ) )",The instruction in general terms directs the robot to eventually arrive at the yellow room while constantly avoiding any possible route through the red room. The robot can use any path available excluding pathways through the red room to ultimately reach the yellow room.
"finally ( and (  go to the blue room , finally ( go to the yellow room )  )  )","The instruction is telling the robot to eventually move to the blue and yellow rooms, with the stipulation that it must visit the blue room before going to the yellow one. It can be described in diverse ways, ranging from simply 'moving to the blue room and then to the yellow room', to instructing the robot to 'navigate through the blue area to reach the yellow one'. Synonyms for the colours or the shapes of the rooms can also be used to convey the same instruction. The order of moving to the blue room before the yellow room is a crucial part of this task."
"finally ( and (  go to the green room , finally ( go to the blue room )  )  )","The instruction denotes that the robot should eventually reach the blue room, but it must first go through the green room. This sequence can be described in various ways such as, the robot moves through the green room to get to the blue room, or the robot enters the blue room by way of the green room. The order of rooms visited is important. The robot should first enter the green room before finally making it into the blue room. Any deviation from this pattern, such as going directly to the blue room without going through the green room first, would not fulfill the instruction."
finally go to the green room,"The instruction 'finally go to the green room' implies that the robot should ultimately reach the green room. This action may be completed in various ways including, but not limited to, 'moving' to the green room or 'going into' the green room, regardless of the robot's prior movements or actions. The commonality among all instructions is the final arrival at the green room."
"and ( finally ( go to the green room ) , globally ( not ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction is directing the robot to navigate its way to the green room, while simultaneously avoiding any encounters with the blue room. It does not matter what path the robot takes or how it accomplishes this task, as long as its journey culminates in the green room and the blue room is never entered during this process. This can be achieved regardless of the sizes or shapes of rooms, or whether rooms are described as 'areas.'"
"and ( finally ( go to the yellow room ) , globally ( not ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction in general terms can be described as a navigational task for the robot where the final destination is the yellow room but the path must not include the blue room under any circumstances. Regardless of synonyms or the properties the rooms might have (such as size), the robot is to directly or indirectly get to the yellow room while avoiding the blue room completely."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the red room , go to the blue room ) , finally ( go to the green room ) ) )","The given linear temporal instruction indicates a traversal order of navigating through rooms distinguished by color. The robot is instructed to eventually navigate through either the red or the blue room, with a final or eventual destination of the green room. The order of approach for the red and blue rooms is interchangeable, the important point is that one of those rooms must be crossed before eventually reaching the green room. The yellow room is not indicated to be in the path or a required destination in the instructions."
finally go to the yellow room,"This linear temporal instruction indicates that eventually, the robot must move to the yellow room. The command can be expressed in a variety of ways, such as 'go to the yellow room', 'move to the yellow room', or 'exit room and go right to the yellow room'. The directive can also specify a series of movements, like going from the blue room to the red room, and then to the yellow room. Ultimately, the required final destination remains the yellow room, regardless of the preceding actions or the specific wording of the command."
"and ( finally ( go to the blue room ) , globally ( not ( go to the green room ) ) )","The instruction involves the robot finding its way to the blue room, with the key condition being that it must not go through the green room at any point. This direction can be interpreted to mean to avoid the green room entirely on the route to the blue room. It doesn't matter how the robot reaches the blue room, whether it goes through the red room or the yellow room, as long as it doesn't enter or pass through the green room. Thus, the robot must always identify and avoid the green room while focusing on finally reaching the blue room."
"and ( finally ( go to the green room ) , globally ( not ( go to the red room ) ) )","The instruction tells the robot to eventually reach the 'green' room without passing through any 'red' room at all times. Variations of this instruction could include phrases like ""go to the green room without going through the red room"", ""move to the green room while avoiding the red room"", or ""avoid red areas while proceeding to green areas"". The focus is on the final destination, the green room, and the constant condition of avoiding the red room. However, the scenario allows for other color rooms not specified in the instruction to be navigated."
"finally ( and (  go to the red room , finally ( go to the blue room )  )  )","This instruction directs the robot to travel to the red room first, and afterwards to the blue room. It can be represented in various ways such as directly moving to the red room then the blue room, going through or via the red room to get to the blue room, or passing through the red room to reach the blue room. The rooms might also be described in terms of their characteristics, such as their size or shape. The essential element across all these examples, however, is the task sequence: the red room must be visited before the blue room."
"and ( finally ( go to the yellow room ) , globally ( not ( go to the green room ) ) )","This instruction involves navigating towards a destination, specifically the yellow room, while consistently avoiding a certain room, in this case, the green room. This action can be performed through any route or through any other rooms as long as the green room is not entered at any point. Variations of this instruction can include 'go to the yellow room but don't go through the green room', 'move to the yellow room without entering a green room', or 'get to the yellow room by avoiding the green room'. The ultimate aim is to ensure that the final destination is the yellow room, and the green room is avoided throughout this journey."
"and ( finally ( go to the red room ) , globally ( not ( go to the green room ) ) )","This instruction guides the robot to navigate towards the red room while completely avoiding any interaction with the green room. The robot must reach its destination, the red room, without stepping into the green room. Essentially, it highlights two actions - the final goal of reaching the red room and the constant rule of not going into the green room, under any circumstances. The task can be communicated by using variations of 'go', 'move', 'drive', 'walk', 'reach', or 'enter' to signify the robot's movement towards the red room, and 'avoid', 'not use', 'not go through', or 'without passing through' to emphasize the prohibition of entering the green room."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the green room , go to the yellow room ) , finally ( go to the red room ) ) )","This instruction asserts that at some point in the future, the robot must pass through either the green or yellow room, and eventually end up in the red room. There is flexibility in the initial choice of rooms - green or yellow - but the final destination is always the red room. This instruction might be used in scenarios where green and yellow rooms serve as transitional rooms or contain objects needed before proceeding to the red room."
"finally ( and (  go to the green room , finally ( go to the yellow room )  )  )","The instruction essentially directs the robot to ultimately reach the 'yellow' room, but only after passing through the 'green' room. This means the robot must traverse the 'green' room first before arriving in the 'yellow' room, regardless of its initial location or the path it might take. The instructions can be interpreted in a flexible manner to include situations where the robot goes through multiple rooms - it just needs to ensure it goes via the 'green' room prior to reaching the 'yellow' room."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the red room , go to the blue room ) , finally ( go to the yellow room ) ) )",This temporal instruction is requesting the robot to traverse either a red room or a blue room before finally reaching a yellow room. The color of the room here is significant for route determination: The traversal within red or blue should occur before eventual entry into a yellow room. The instruction doesn't explicitly insist on avoiding any of other colored rooms while traveling but the ultimate objective is reaching the yellow room after passing through either the red or blue one.
"and ( finally ( go to the red room ) , globally ( not ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction requires the robot to eventually arrive in the red room, while throughout its action it should avoid the blue room at all costs. The request can be represented in various ways, often asking the robot to traverse any room that is not blue to finally reach the red room, or to make its way to the red room without passing or using the blue room. The instructions may also explicitly tell the robot to avoid the blue room while moving to the red one. These cues are not limited to rooms but can also apply to similarly color-coded areas."
finally go to the red room,"This instruction involves guiding the robot to eventually arrive at a specific room, which is the red room in this case. Variations of the term 'red room' such as 'pink room' can also be used to denote the destination. The manner in which the robot is guided to the room can also vary with phrases like 'go to', 'move to', or 'enter' being used in different combinations. However, the robot's final destination remains the same, which is the 'red room'."
"finally ( and (  go to the blue room , finally ( go to the green room )  )  )","This instruction indicates a task sequence that involves the robot first going to the blue room and subsequently to the green room. The task is completed when the robot has entered both rooms in the specified order, represented by the blue room first, followed by the green room. The action can be carried out in various ways including going through, entering, moving to, crossing or walking to the rooms and the rooms can also be referred to with synonymous terms. The phrase 'finally' implies the end goal which in this case is to reach the green room after having been in the blue room."
"finally ( and (  go to the green room , finally ( go to the red room )  )  )","The instruction in its general terms asks the robot to reach the red room but it must do so by passing through the green room first. This can be interpreted in various scenarios such as entering the red room via the green room, moving to reach the red place through a path that includes the green color, passing through the green room to get to the red room, or moving into the red room via the green room. This sequence must be followed in any situation; first the green room, then finally, the red room."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the green room , go to the red room ) , finally ( go to the blue room ) ) )","This instruction directs the robot to eventually reach the blue room regardless of its current location. However, before accessing the blue room, it has the option to pass through either the green room or the red room. The journey through one of these rooms (green or red) is all part of reaching the final destination, which is the blue room."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the red room , go to the green room ) , finally ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction entails guiding the robot to eventually reach a blue room. However, the path to get there usually requires passing through either a red or a green room first. This instruction does not imply a specific order and the rooms red and green may be interchangeable. Also, synonymous colors could be used in place of the specific color rooms. The robot eventually has to end up in a blue room (or a synonymous color)."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the green room , go to the yellow room ) , finally ( go to the blue room ) ) )","The instruction directs the robot to go to the blue room, but it must first pass through either the green room or the yellow room. This progression can occur in no particular order and offers flexibility in the sequence of rooms visited. However, it is essential that the final destination is the blue room after the robot has been in either the yellow or the green room. This could be interpreted as the robot navigating towards the blue room from the starting point in either the green or yellow room, or the robot could pass through either the green or yellow rooms before reaching the final blue room. This offers the opportunity to modify the path based on the specific layout of the rooms."
"finally ( and (  go to the red room , finally ( go to the yellow room )  )  )","The instruction in general terms is telling the robot to go to the red room first and then proceed to the yellow room. The robot may be in any room, but should finish its task in the yellow room. The transition from the red room to the yellow room is mandatory in all given examples. The command does not specify the actions in between these movements, allowing the robot some flexibility in how it navigates between these rooms."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the yellow room , go to the blue room ) , finally ( go to the green room ) ) )","The instruction requires the robot to move towards the green room by first passing through either the yellow or blue room. It shows a preference for the green room, but before reaching this destination, the robot must travel through one of two alternative rooms - yellow or blue. In this scenario, the yellow and blue rooms serve as potential paths for reaching the ultimate goal, which is the green room. This movement can occur through any shape or form associated with those colors. In some cases, other colors can be mentioned but the main instruction is about navigating through yellow or blue to get to the green room."
"and ( finally ( go to the red room ) , globally ( not ( go to the yellow room ) ) )","The instruction guides the robot to find and go to the 'red' room while concurrently guiding it to consistently avoid any approach to the 'yellow' room. That is, the robot is ultimately expected to reach the red room, but it should never enter the yellow room at any point during its navigation. Various wordings and room descriptions can be used to communicate this instruction, and it can apply to any scenario where the robot has to favor one destination (the red room) and evade another (the yellow room)."
"finally ( and ( or ( go to the blue room , go to the yellow room ) , finally ( go to the green room ) ) )","The instruction is guiding the robot to navigate to the green room, but it must first pass through either the blue room or the yellow room. The destination (green room) is always precise, while the pathway to that destination can be through either one of two rooms (blue or yellow). However, there is no direct access from the starting point to the green room without passing through the blue or yellow room. This route can be interpreted in various ways such as going through, reaching, moving or entering the green room through the yellow or blue room."
