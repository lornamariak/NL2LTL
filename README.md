Natural Language to Linear Temporal Language using LLM context and T5

### Abstract

This paper introduces an alternative framework for translating natural language instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) for robotic systems. The proposed method bridges the gap between human communicationâ€™s intuitive nature and the structured requirements of robotic task execution. Utilizing a sequence-to-sequence model (T5) enhanced with GPT-4 for context generation, this approach significantly advances robotic understanding and execution of complex, temporally-bound tasks. The method shows promising results, achieving accuracy of 83% and 81.5% on the Cleanup and Drone Planning datasets, demonstrating its generalizability and practical applicability in robotic task specification.
